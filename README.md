# Zero Framework Blog
A zero dependency blog, created from scratch. Created for the [Replit Template Jam](https://blog.replit.com/template-jam).

NOTE: if you're here from a template, go to `configInternals.json` and set `demo` to false. Then run the Repl.

## Features
- unique onboarding process

- 0 frameworks
    - Zero Markdown Renderer
    - Zero Templating Engine
    - Zero Server
    - Zero web component framework
        - Syntax highlighter component
        - Custom SPA router
        - Bootlegged Repl Auth

- writing posts (obviously)
    - post metadata can control features (ie: emoji splashscreen)
    - Replit users can comment on posts

## Usage

### Writing Posts
Anything added to the `posts` directory will be accessible to users at `/posts/{filename}`. You must include certain fields at the top of any post or the application may crash. 

Here's what a post header should look like:
```
---
title: 5 CSS Tricks to Make Your Site Less Crap
emoji: ðŸ¥³
date: 6/4/2022
tags: tech, css
---

Post content can go here!
```

Although the markdown renderer supports a variety of elements (and you can just inline your own HTML tags), there are some known limitations. You cannot, for example, have nested lists. 

### Configuration
Settings are applied in the onboarding process, which basically controls `configInternals.json`. 

```js
{
    "port": 5500, // port server should listen to
    "genesis": true, // show onboarding
    "demo": true, // prevents demo from being overwritten (disable for personal projects)
    "author": {
        "avatar": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1520125126271922179/ds8zJhJV_400x400.jpg",
        "name": "Nathan Pham",
        "bio": "Mathematician, designer, farmer, student. Engineer would be stretching the titles a bit.",

        // links are not required
        "links": {
            "github": "https://github.com/nathan-pham",
            "twitter": "https://twitter.com/phamn23",
            "personal": "https://nathanpham.me"
        }
    }
}
```

These settings are self explanatory, but I've also provided some comments.
