# Hello World

This blog was created for the [Replit Template Jam](https://blog.replit.com/template-jam).

This is the first post in my new blog! Take a look around. Everything you see (both frontend and backend) is built with vanilla JavaScript. No frameworks or libraries at all. Although my code is pretty crap and is likely not as performant and tested as other maintained frameworks and repositories, it's important to recognize the value of responsible and good-old fashioned code.

## Replit Features

Ok obviously we didn't use _zero_ libraries or frameworks. We used some cool Replit features!

-   Replit Database for comments
-   Replit Auth for comments

## Project Timeline

Here are some important milestones in this project:

1. Day 1: new Replit project to serve static resources
2. Day 2 - 3: created a [Markdown renderer](https://github.com/nathan-pham/markdown-renderer) from scratch
3. Day 4: created a [Templating Engine](https://github.com/nathan-pham/templating-engine) from scratch
4. Day 5 - 6: created primary styles for the home and post page

## Example Markdown Supported

Just testing out some styles for the `Markdown` renderer. Here's my Twitter banner:

Here's a code block:

```js
let x = 10;
x += 10;
```

Here's a blockquote:
