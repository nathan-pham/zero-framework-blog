# Hello World

This blog was created for the [Replit Template Jam](https://blog.replit.com/template-jam).

This is the first post in my new blog! Take a look around. Everything is created from scratch, no libraries or frameworks. If you do manage to take a look at the source code, all of the backend and frontend standalone tools I created are usually prefixed with `Zero` (see below for links to those individual projects).

Although I used vanilla JS, it is important to recognize the advantages and utility of more maintained repositories, which are generally more performant and tested by thousands of developers.

## Replit Features (and other mentions)

Okay, technically we did use _some_ libraries. We used some cool Replit features!

-   Replit Database: comments
-   Replit Auth: comments

I'd also like to thank

-   Zenn.dev: primary inspiration for design
-   Radix: SVG icons
-   my past self for creating so much random stuff that I could literally just reuse it in this random specific context

## Project Timeline

Here are some important milestones in this project:

1. Day 1: new Replit project to serve static resources
2. Day 2 - 3: created a [Markdown renderer](https://github.com/nathan-pham/markdown-renderer) from scratch
3. Day 4: created a [Templating Engine](https://github.com/nathan-pham/templating-engine) from scratch
4. Day 5 - 6: created primary styles for the home and post page
5. Day 7 - 8: created Zero Framework
6. Day 9 - 10: rewrote old frontend with Zero
7. Day 11: Bug fixes on Markdown Renderer & Zero Framework
8. Day 12: More styles on post pages (especially table of contents)

Note: Zero is really unstable so I probably shot myself in the foot by remaking the entire app with it, but at least it's a framework I made so it's still "Vanilla JS".

# Example Markdown Supported

Just testing out some styles for the `Markdown` renderer. Here's my Twitter banner:

Here's a blockquote:

Here's a code block:

```js
let x = 10;
x += 10;
```
